This **newsletter naming tool** is meant to help you generate names that follow a convention. Feel free to use the [hosted instance](https://nvs.that.ee/newsletter-naming-tool/) or download the HTML file and use it locally (on your computer). Also, feel free to experiment with the code if you need to modify it to meet your needs. Don't be afraid to break anything, as you can always download the file again from this GitHub repository.
